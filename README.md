# An example of React Router v7 + Cloudflare Workers: Breakout Game

This project was created to demonstrate how React Router v7 and Cloudflare Workers make it easy and cost-effective to build and deploy full-stack applications. As a deployment example, we chose a "Breakout" game. Since I am one of the organizers of the [Functional Programming Matsuri (FP Matsuri)](https://2025.fp-matsuri.org/), the ball in the game features the FP Matsuri logo as a fun touch.

## Features

- üöÄ Server-side rendering with React Router
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for fast development
- üì¶ Asset bundling and optimization via Vite

## Game Overview

This project includes a classic "Breakout" game implemented in React.
- Control the paddle with your mouse or arrow keys.
- The game ends when you lose all your lives or clear all the bricks.
- The ball's bounce angle changes depending on where it hits the paddle.
- The game uses a custom React reducer for state management and the canvas element for rendering.

This Breakout game implementation is heavily inspired by and based on the excellent tutorial from MDN Web Docs:

Special thanks and full respect to the MDN contributors for their clear, educational, and open resources on web game development.

We would also like to express our gratitude to Cloudflare for providing an outstanding developer experience and a powerful platform that makes global deployment simple and affordable.
